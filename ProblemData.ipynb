    "# Problem\n",
    "There are many people seeking to buy or build a house. However, it takes too much effort to search for information regarding the area that they want to purchase or build a house in. So, we need an easier source of information to help them decide if they want to purchase or build a house at that area. We need to take into the following infomaation in to consideration for this problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "+ crime rate near the house\n",
    "+ shopping facilities near the house\n",
    "+ dining facilities near the house\n",
    "+ entertainment facilities near the house\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Therefore it would be optimal if there was a map that plotted out all the relevant information to aid in house purchase decisions. So this project will render a map of **san francisco** and the crime rate and entertainment facilities to help decision making. \n",

    "People looking for houses or wanting to build a house often lack the information needed to determin if they are willing to buy certain houses or build their houses at certain areas, such information includes:\n",
    "\n",

    "+ dining facilities near the house\n",
    "+ entertainment facilities near the house\n",

    "<br>\n",
    "Therefore it would be optimal if there was a map that plotted out all the relevant information to aid in house purchase decisions. So this project will render a map of **san francisco** and the crime rate and entertainment facilities to help decision making. \n",
